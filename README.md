# WouldYouRather Project

This is the finished code of the second project submission for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program implemented by Silvio Schmidt.  
WouldYouRather is a React webapp that allows users to create WouldYouRather-polls, answer questions of other users and compete to be the one who answered and created most.  
The goal of the exercise was to heavily focus on Redux for state management.

## Installation
Simply clone the repo, npm install and npm start.

## Features

- Creating binary polls, like "Would you rather ... A: fight the Hulk, or B: fight Thanos"
- Answering polls of other users and see the distribution of how others decided
- Climb the ranks in the leaderboard by answering and asking the most questions

### Built with

- The usual suspects (React, Redux, NPM)
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting (in VSCode)
